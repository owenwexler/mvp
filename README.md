# SuperRetroWeather
## An open-source 8-bit weather app by Owen Wexler
SuperRetroWeather is an open-source weather app with a twist - an 8-bit retro experience that takes you right back to the good old days of the Nintendo Entertainment System. Just type your location into the search box and you can get a variety of weather data for your city in a fun nostalgic 8-bit package. As an added bonus, the app also remembers the last five locations you visited!
